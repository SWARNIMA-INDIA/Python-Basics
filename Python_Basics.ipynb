        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "  - Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its     simplicity, readability, and wide range of libraries.\n",
        "  It is popular because it is easy to learn and used in many fields like data science, AI, and web development.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - Interpreter reads the code line by line and runs it.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words that have special meaning in Python.\n",
        "  (e.g., if, else, for, while, True, False, def).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, we cannot use keywords as variable names.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability means we can change the value after creation.\n",
        "  (e.g., lists are mutable; tuples and strings are immutable.)\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists can be modified because they are designed to change frequently, while tuples are fixed and used for constant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "   - “==” checks if two values are equal or not.\n",
        "   - “is” checks if both names or variables are pointing to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "   - There are three logical operators in python:\n",
        "     - AND - Returns True if both operands are true.\n",
        "     - OR - Returns True if at least one operand is true.\n",
        "     - NOT -  Flips the Boolean value of its operand; returns True if the operand is false.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "   - Changing one data type to another is called type casting.\n",
        "   Example: int(\"5\") changes string to integer.\n",
        "            float(3) changes integer to float.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "   - Implicit: Python changes type automatically.\n",
        "   - Explicit: We change type using functions like int(), float(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "   - Conditional statements check conditions and run code accordingly.\n",
        "   Example: if, elif, else.\n",
        "   - key purposes are:\n",
        "     - Decision making — like turning left or right.\n",
        "     - Control program flow to handle different scenarios (such as user input, data values, or states).\n",
        "     - Enable algorithms to perform varies actions depending on context or requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "   -  It checks additional conditions after if. If (if) is false, Python checks elif.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "   - For loop: Use it when we know how many times to repeat (like going through a list).\n",
        "   - While loop: Use it when we keep repeating until a condition changes (we do not know how many times).\n",
